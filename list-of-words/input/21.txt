BEFORE I BEGIN WITH LESSONS LET US TRY AND UNDERSTAND A FEW CONCEPTS RELATED TO POWERPOINT 1 PPT I AM GOING TO USE THE TERM PPT FREELY TO DENOTE THE TERM POWERPOINT PRESENTATION UNDOUBTEDLY THE TERM COMES FROM THE DEFAULT EXTENSION FOR ANY PPT WHEN YOU TRY TO SAVE IT FOR E G BLOG PPT 2 SLIDE THE BASIC RAW MATERIAL OF A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION YOUR PPT IS NOTHING BUT A COLLECTION OF SLIDES ARRANGED AND SEQUENCED IN A MANNER SO AS TO CONVEY A COHERENT AND IMPACTFUL MESSAGE TO YOUR AUDIENCE THE SLIDE ITSELF WILL CONTAIN THE TEXT IMAGES VIDEOS GRAPHS ETC THAT YOU WILL USE AS CONTENT EACH SLIDE HAS AN AREA THAT YOU CAN USE TO ADD THE CONTENT OF THE PRESENTATION ONCE YOU HAVE EXHAUSTED THE SPACE AVAILABLE ON A PARTICULAR SLIDE YOU CAN CONTINUE BY CREATING A NEW SLIDE THIS IS DONE BY GOING TO THE INSERT MENU AND CLICKING ON NEW SLIDE ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN USE THE SHORTCUT CTRL M 3 SLIDE MASTER THE SLIDE MASTER SLIDE IS THE TEMPLATE FOR YOUR PPT YOU CAN ADD ALL KINDS OF CONTENT ON YOUR MASTER SLIDE ONCE YOU HAVE ADDED THE CONTENT ON THE MASTER SLIDE YOU CAN GET BACK TO ADDING THE REAL MEAT OF THE PRESENTATION IN THE INDIVIDUAL SLIDES THE SLIDE MASTER WILL STAY IN THE BACKGROUND OF YOUR PRESENTATION THROUGHOUT ALL THE SLIDES USED SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW YOU PUT YOUR STUFF ON IT MORE ON ACCESSING AND MODIFYING THE SLIDE MASTER LATER THE SLIDE MASTER CAN BE USED TO GREAT EFFECT SINCE YOU DEFINE THE FONTS COLORS AND EVEN THE ANIMATION THAT YOU WOULD WANT FOR INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS IN THE SLIDES FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES THE SLIDE MASTER IS NOTHING BUT A WELL THOUGHT OUT AND CRISPLY PLANNED LAYOUT 4 LAYOUT LAYOUT IS ESSENTIALLY THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS ON A SLIDE SLIDE MASTER THIS COULD INVOLVE THE AFOREMENTIONED CONTENT AND OR OTHER OBJECTS LIKE BOXES ARROWS CIRCLES ETC THAT YOU WILL FIND FREELY IN THE APPLICATION POWERPOINT COMES WITH A SET OF DEFAULT CONTENT LAYOUTS THAT YOU CAN USE TO CREATE THE PRESENTATION IT IS UNLIKELY AND SOMETIMES INADVISABLE THAT YOU WILL NEED TO WORK WITH A BLANK CONTENT LAYOUT IN YOUR PPT UNLESS YOU PLAN TO USE ANIMATION OF VARIOUS OBJECTS EXTENSIVELY I USE THE TERM OBJECTS TO ALLUDE TO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT S PRESENT ON A SLIDE BE IT TEXT GRAPHICS OR ANY OTHER THE LAYOUT IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF YOUR PPT AFTER THE CONTENT OF COURSE SINCE IT PRETTY MUCH DEFINES HOW YOUR OBJECTS ARE GOING TO APPEAR ON THE SLIDES LAYOUTS ARE LINKED TO THE SLIDE MASTER AND IF YOU USE THE LAYOUT SMARTLY THEN IT BECOMES REALLY EASY TO MANIPULATE ANIMATE AND PLACE THE OBJECTS PROPERLY IT GREATLY SPEEDS UP THE WHOLE PROCESS SOMETHING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT CONSIDERING THAT MOST PEOPLE TEND TO WORK ON PPT S ONLY AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR 5 TITLE SUBTITLE THIS IS THE TITLE OF YOUR PRESENTATION E G TITLE BLOGOPRATS SUBTITLE CASE STUDY OF A BLOG ADDICT ALTERNATIVELY IT COULD ALSO BE THE TITLE OF INDIVIDUAL SECTIONS OF YOUR PPT FOR E G THE BLOGOPRATS PRESENTATION COULD HAVE SECTIONS VIZ BRIEF HISTORY THE FIRST POST BLOGGER IN LOVE THE 6TH BLOG CONCLUSION EACH OF THESE SECTIONS COULD BE INTRODUCED WITH A TITLE SLIDE AS WELL FOR EFFECT 6 TITLE MASTER JUST LIKE THE SLIDE MASTER THE TITLE MASTER IS USED TO DICTATE THE TEMPLATE FOR THE TITLE SLIDES THUS YOU COULD HAVE SEPARATE LAYOUTS AND FONT TYPES ETC FOR THE TITLE AND INNER SLIDES WE WILL COVER THE TITLE MASTER IN MORE DEPTH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ACCESSING AND MODIFYING THE SLIDE MASTER 7 ANIMATION AN OFTEN ABUSED AND GREATLY APPRECIATED FEATURE OF POWERPOINT IS THE ABILITY TO ANIMATE VARIOUS OBJECTS IN THE SLIDE SLIDE MASTER OLDER VERSIONS OF POWERPOINT WERE QUITE BASIC IN THEIR OFFERINGS FOR ANIMATION HOWEVER XP AND NOW 2003 HAVE VERILY REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY YOU CAN PRESENT AN OBJECT IN YOUR SLIDE SO POWERFUL IS THE ANIMATION FEATURE THAT YOU CAN SET DIFFERENT ANIMATION ATTRIBUTES SPIRAL GIMBAL FLY ZOOM ETC TO INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS SIMULTANEOUSLY OR SEQUENTIALLY MORE ON THIS LATER 8 SLIDE TRANSITION TIMING NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH ANIMATION SLIDE TRANSITION REFERS TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PRESENT EACH SLIDE YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM A LONG LIST OF OPTIONS TO SELECT THE WAY YOU WANT YOUR SLIDE TO APPEAR WHEN YOU GO TO IT YOU CAN EVEN DEFINE SET TIMINGS FOR EACH SLIDE I E DEFINE THE TIME DURATION FOR WHICH A SLIDE IS DISPLAYED BEFORE THE NEXT ONE APPEARS IN ITS PLACE THIS IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL WHEN YOU ARE SENDING A PPT VIA EMAIL AND NEED TO PRESERVE THE NARRATIVE ASPECT OF YOUR PPT 9 SLIDE SHOW THIS IS THE COMMAND SHORT CUT F5 THAT YOU USE TO RUN OR EXECUTE YOUR PPT WHILE YOU ARE IN EDIT MODE PRESSING F5 WILL RESULT IN THE PPT BEING EXECUTED FROM THE FIRST SLIDE EVEN IF YOU ARE ON SLIDE 10 FOR EXAMPLE F5 WILL CAUSE THE PRESENTATION TO RUN FROM THE FIRST SLIDE AND NOT FROM SLIDE 10 THIS IS A COMMON MISTAKE MADE BY MOST PEOPLE WHILE YOU ARE RUNNING A SLIDE SHOW YOU CAN DO VARIOUS THINGS LIKE BLACK WHITE OUT A SLIDE HIDE THE MOUSE POINTER ETC IF YOU CLICK F1 WHILE YOU ARE IN SLIDE SHOW MODE YOU GET THE COMPLETE LIST OF SHORTCUTS AND THEIR INTENDED FUNCTIONS 10 THUMBRULE 1 AVOID LENGTHY PRESENTATIONS A GOOD PRESENTATION IS USUALLY 15 SLIDES ROUGHLY UNLESS THE PRESENTATION IS REALLY TECHNICAL IN NATURE AND EXPLORES THE SUBJECT IN DEPTH E G FINANCE TECHNOLOGY MOST OF YOUR AUDIENCE TEND TO GET BORED WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF YOUR PPT AND IT GETS PROGRESSIVELY WORSE WITH TIME SO REMEMBER KISS KEEP IT SHORT N SIMPLE I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE CONCEPT I WILL BE ELABORATING A LOT MORE IN THE POSTS TO COME I WILL REALLY APPRECIATE ALL FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS FROM YOU I AM SURE THEY ARE GOING TO HELP IN MAKING THIS ENTIRE IDEA REALLY WORTHWHILE FOR BOTH YOU AND ME
FOR BEGINNERS I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME ADMITTEDLY URLLINK M S COMMENT ON ONE OF MY EARLIER POSTS IN URLLINK A2D REALLY GOT ME MOTIVATED TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO HERE THIS BLOG WILL DEAL WITH ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING ABOUT POWERPOINT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THIS REALLY IMAGINATIVE TOOL FROM THE GATES FACTORY AFTER ALL POWERPOINT IS A GREAT TOOL AND ITS BASIC IDEA IS NOT REALLY ABOUT CORPORATE PRESENTATIONS OR BOARDROOM MANOUEVRES IT S ESSENTIALLY A GREAT COMMUNICATION MEDIUM THAT CAN BE USED TO PRESENT JUST ABOUT ANY THOUGHT IDEA THAT ANY PERSON MIGHT HAVE I HAVE SEEN POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS THAT HAVE USED A PLAY OF SIMPLE OBJECTS TEXT IMAGES SOUND TO CONVEY ANYTHING FROM HUMOUR TO CONCEPTS TO PROMOTING SOCIAL CAUSES AND THE BEST PART IS THAT IT S SO ABSURDLY SIMPLE ANYONE WITH A LIL IMAGINATION AND BASIC FAMILIARITY WITH POWERPOINT CAN GO AHEAD AND MAKE A MIND BLOWING PRESENTATION THAT HITS THE NAIL ON THE SPOT THAT S WHAT WE WANT TO DO RIGHT
NO I AM NOT GIVING UP ON THIS BLOG JUST BEEN TOO BUSY WORKING ON POWERPOINT WHAT ELSE SO IT S TIME TO BEGIN OUR POWERPOINT LESSONS NOW BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT LET S GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE BASIC LAYOUT OF POWERPOINT NOTE I WORK ON OFFICE XP AND HENCE ALL THE LESSONS FEATURES WILL RELATE TO THE XP VERSION OF POWERPOINT THERE WOULD BE SOME FEATURE MISMATCHES IN OTHER VERSIONS HOWEVER THE BASIC STUFF REMAINS THE SAME TAKE A LOOK AT URLLINK THIS I AM FOLLOWING A GENERAL SCHEMA THAT SEGREGATES THE VARIOUS TOOLS BASED ON CATEGORIES SUCH AS GRAPHIC TEXT ETC I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THEM IN THE PICTURE I USE 1024X768 RESOLUTION FOR MY PC SCREEN SO THAT ALLOWS ME TO ADD MORE ICONS ON THE TABS PROVIDED SO HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT GETTING THIS LAYOUT WELL FOR STARTERS CLICK ON THE POWERPOINT ICON IN YOUR START MENU PROGRAMS YOU WILL SEE A LAYOUT NOT DISSIMILAR TO THE ONE I HAVE NEXT YOU RIGHT CLICK ON ONE OF THE TABS ON THE TOP AND CLICK ON CUSTOMIZE THEN CLICK ON FORMAT AND DRAG N DROP THE VARIOUS ICONS ONTO THE RELEVANT AREAS IN POWERPOINT THE ALIGN AND DISTRIBUTE ICON HOWEVER CAN T BE FOUND IN THE FORMAT OPTION NOT IN XP AT LEAST YOU CAN FIND IT UNDER THE DRAW ICON ON THE BOTTOM LEFT EXTREME OF THE PAGE I WILL ELABORATE ON THE USES OF THESE ICONS AS WE GO ALONG
