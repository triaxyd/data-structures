MY PLAN FOR HANNAH IS SIMILAR TO SARAH S ONLY IN THE MATH CURRICULUM HANNAH WILL BE USING HANDS ON MANIPULATIVES CALLED FRACTION LAYOVERS AND WILL ALSO SHARE THE BLOCKS WITH HER SISTER THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO TEACH THE CHILD MORE CRITICAL THINKING AND TO GIVE THEM A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MATH THAT THEY ARE LEARNING AND NOW TO USE IT AND APPLY IT IN LIFE I AM SURE SHE WILL DO GREAT NOW HER OTHER CURRICULUM IS CALLED TOTAL LANGUAGE PLUS THIS IS BASED ON THE READING OF A LOT OF LITERATURE AND SIMILARLY TO THE MATH CURRICULUM WILL TEACH HER CRITICAL THINKING MAKE HER THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND COME UP WITH HER OWN ANSWERS AND IDEAS HANNAH S SPELLING GRAMMAR AND VOCABULARY WILL ALSO COME FROM THIS LANGUAGE PROGRAM PLUS ONCE AGAIN WE WILL BE DOING A LOT OF UNIT STUDIES TO INCORPORATE EVERY AREA OF THEIR EDUCATION WE AS A FAMILY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO A LOT OF FIELD TRIPS IN OUR RV FOR THESE UNIT STUDIES WASHINGTON D C MT RUSHMORE GRAND CANYON WILLIAMSBURG UNDERGROUND RAILROAD ETC I THINK HANNAH IS GOING TO GROUP SPIRITUALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR
MY PLAN FOR SARAH IS TO REALLY CONCENTRATE ON HER COMPREHENSION OF PHONICS I AM STARTING HER ON A PROGRAM CALLED EXPLODE THE CODE THIS SHOULD GIVE HER A FIRM FOUNDATION TO BUILD HER READING SKILLS ON HOPEFULLY BOOST HER CONFIDENCE SO THAT SHE WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH READING IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT I DON T FORCE HER TO READ BOOKS RIGHT NOW JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE CODE AND GIVE HER A CHANCE TO DEVELOP HER READING SKILLS I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS BASICALLY CALLED DELAYED ACADEMICS AND IF WE GIVE OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIME TO GET READY NATURALLY THEN THEY WILL SOAR AS SOON AS IT CLICKS KIND OF LIKE POTTY TRAINING A TODDLER YOU CAN T FORCE THEM UNTIL THEY ARE READY I ALSO ORDERED HER A MATH CURRICULUM WITH MANIPULATIVE BLOCKS TO TEACH HER TO UNDERSTAND THE MATH THAT SHE IS LEARNING NOT JUST MEMORIZE IT IT LOOKS FUN THOSE ARE MY MAIN TWO FOCUS POINTS FOR SARAH FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS THEN OF COURSE I WILL BE USING UNIT STUDIES ON ALL KINDS OF FUN TOPICS TO INCORPORATE THE SPELLING HISTORY SCIENCE CRAFTS ETC
