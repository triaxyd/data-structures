I WANT TO USE THIS BLOG TO HELP ORGANIZE A FEW IDEAS WHICH HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ESSENTIALLY JUST AS PHYSICISTS SEEK A GRAND UNIFIED THEORY TO COMBINE THE STRONG WEAK ELECTRO MAGNETIC AND GRAVITATIONAL FORCES I M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING OF A GRAND UNIFIED THEORY OF THE HUMANITIES THIS IS NO SMALL TASK TO BE SURE I HAVE NO OR LITTLE FORMAL TRAINING FOR SUCH A TASK I HAVE DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF READING AND A HELL OF A LOT OF THINKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE OR ABOUT THESE ISSUES IF YOU WILL BUT IF I DON T ORGANIZE AND COMMUNICATE THEM MY EFFORTS WON T DO ANYONE ANY GOOD THE FIRST FEW BLOGS WILL MOST LIKELY ATTEMPT TO DISCERN A NATURAL HIERARCHY A METHOD BYWHICH BLOGS ARE BEST ORGANIZED
INTERESTING THE IDEA THAT THERE S ONE TRUTH SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE MONOTHEISM TO SPEAK IN A NIETZSCHEAN SENSE THE IDEA OF ONE TRUTH IS A SUBLIMATION OF THE BELIEF IN AND FAITH OF ONE GOD THE SAME URGE THAT DRIVES MEN OF AND TO ONE GOD DRIVES OTHERS TO ONE TRUTH AND IN SCIENCES ONE METHOD THE SCIENTIFIC OF ARRIVING AT THAT TRUTH IN MANY RESPECTS BELIEF IN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS A BELIEF IN UNCERTAINTY ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT SCIENTIFIC BELIEFS ARE PREDICATED ON THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD INDEED BE INCORRECT OF COURSE IT S EASY TO COME TO BELIEVE ABSOLUTELY IN ONE S SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSION S TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT THERE EXISTED NO PLANETS OTHER THAN THOSE IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM TODAY WE KNOW OF SEVERAL SCIENCE IS A KIND OF FAITH IN UNCERTAINTY IT IS A SORT OF MAGIC THAT IS PROVEN VERY MUCH AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY VIA PREDICTION ASTRONOMERS PREDICT VENUSIAN SOLAR TRANSITS THE TRANSIT OCCURS THE POWER OF SCIENCE IT S VALIDITY IT S SOVREIGNTY IS THEREBY PROVEN VERY MUCH AS PRIESTLY POWER WAS VALIDATED BY PREDICTIONS OF PLANETARY MOVEMENTS SOLAR AND LUNAR ECLIPSES SO IF WE VIEW RELIGION FAITH AS HAVING NECESSARILY EVOLVED I TEND TO THINK OF RELIGION AS PRECEDING SCIENCE BECAUSE SCIENCE IS VIEWED AS A MODERN METHOD THIS VIEW MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE THIS VIEW MAY BE A STUMBLING BLOCK SCIENCE AND RELIGION HAVE IN COMMON A FAITH IN UNCERTAINTY DRIVEN BY THE DESIRE TO LEARN UNDERSTAND AND CONTROL THE KNOWN WE DON T WISH TO BE EATEN TO DIE FROM ENEMIES OR THE ENVIRONMENT SO WE RE REALLY DISCUSSING THE SUBLIMATION OF POWER AND CONTROL NIETZSCHE AND ADLER
RELIGION SO WHY SHOULD WE AS EXISTENTIAL SCIENTISTS APPRECIATE RELIGION THAT IS TO SAY IF WE AREN T GOING TO RELY ON MUMBO JUMBO TO EXPLAIN THINGS WHY DON T WE DO AWAY WITH IT ALTOGETHER ANOTHER WAY TO ASK THIS QUESTION IS WHY DID RELIGION EVOLVE AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESENCE IN MAN AND THERE S THE ANSWER RELIGION S AFFECT ON MEN IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED BECAUSE IT EVOLVED TOO MANY MEN I THINK UPON LOSING FAITH IN RELIGION OR RATHER APPLYING FAITH TO SOMETHING ELSE WISH TO DENIGRATE THE VALUE OF RELIGION S AFFECTS THEY PROBABLY DO SO TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY WERE ONCE FAITHFUL AND THAT SOUNDS SO NIETZSCEAN THAT HE PROBABLY SAID IT ALREADY THEY DO SO IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RELAPSE OF COURSE WHEN WE SPEAK OF THE EVOLUTION OF RELIGION WE RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY
RELIGION A SCIENTIFIC EXAMINATION OF EXISTENCE SHOULD UTILIZE TWO METHODS IN REACHING CONCLUSIONS ABSENCE OF MUMBO JUMBO MJ ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND APPRECIATION OF MUMBO JUMBO S PRESENCE PERHAPS NECESSITY IN OUR PERCEPTION OF EXISTENCE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS TO AVOID RELIANCE ON MJ FOR PRACTICAL REASONS WE WOULD BE FORCED TO CHOOSE A PARTICULAR MJ UPON WHICH TO BASE OUR OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS WE COULD THEN DELVE INTO SECTS DEBATES OF INACCURACIES AND MEANINGS HISTORICITY ETC ETC SUCH EFFORTS WOULD ACHIEVE LITTLE MORE THAN ARGUMENTS BUILT UPON ARGUMENT UPON ARGUMENT CICULAR REASONING AN EDIFICE UPON A FOUNDATION THAT CRUMBLES AT THE FIRST TREMORS OF REASON OF COURSE IT WOULD BE NO MORE CORRECT TO REJECT MJ SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ONE NO EVEN IF WE BELIEVED THAT IS TO SAY HAD FAITH THAT WE HAD CHOSEN ACTUALY MOST OFTEN INHERITED THE RIGHT MJ WE WOULD BE LEFT WITH LITTLE MORE THAN A SORT OF MY DAD CAN BEAT UP YOUR DAD MENTALITY AND WITH SUCH A MENTALITY WE WOULD THEN NEED TO RELY UPON OTHER PROOFS OF CORRECTNESS THAT IS TO SAY RELIGIOUS SUPERIORITY FOR EXAMPLE A RELIGION IS SUPERIOR BASED UPON SUCH IDEAS AS THE PERCEIVED HAPPINESS OF IT S ADHERENTS COFFERS ORGANIZATIONAL OR NATIONAL NUMBER OF ADHERENTS DURATION OF EXISTENCE IRONICALLY IN ORDER TO PROVE A RELIGION S SUPERIORITY IT WOULD HAVE TO RELY UPON PHYSICAL INDICATORS IN A WORLD DEVALUED BY MOST RELIGIOUS THOUGHT SO FROM A PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW WE CAN T RELY ON MJ TO EXPLAIN UNDERSTAND EXISTENCE BECAUSE WE CAN T CHOOSE THE CORRECT RELIGION AND IF WE DID CHOOSE ONE WOULD BE REDUCED TO USING REAL WORLD PHYSICAL PROOF TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SUPPOSED SUPERIORITY THERE IS ANOTHER REASON IF ONE RELIGION IS THE CORRECT WAY TO GAUGE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EXISTENCE THEN RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE BECOMES A ZER0 SUM GAME THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE WINNER THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE RELIGION SOUNDS LIKE A HIGHLANDER RIFF IT IS EVIDENT THAT ADHERENTS ARE WILLING TO TAKE UP ARMS AND TO KILL IN ORDER TO WIN SUCH A ZER0 SUM GAME IT IS MOST IMPRACTICAL TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CONCLUSION AGAIN IN FACT WE ARE FACED WITH A RELIGION WHICH DISPROVES ITSELF IN IT S EFFORTS TO PROVE ITSELF REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM NOTWITHSTANDING RELIGION DOES PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN OUR EXISTENCE NEXT TIME I LL TALK ABOUT WHY IT S IMPORTANT TO APPRECIATE RELIGION S AFFECT ON US
