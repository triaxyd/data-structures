WAH MAN FINALLY OFF THE PHONE AFTER LIKE NEARLY 10 PHONE CALLS TO ISPS PSTN COMPANIES JUST GOT MY LOCAL HOME PHONE CHANGED TO B… COS MAN IT’S DAMN CHEAP… YEP I RECKON IT IS… COS IT’S ONLY 29 95 FOR LINE RENTAL WHICH IS CHEAPER THAN ANY OPTUS OR TELSTRA LINE – BOTH ABOVE 33 AND NOT ONLY IS IT 29 95… IT INCLUDES 100 LOCAL PHONE CALLS – WE ONLY MAKE LIKE AROUND 70 OR 80 PER MONTH SO WE NEVER HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 29 95 MUCH CHEAPER THAN WHAT WE PAY WHICH WE USED TO PAY WHICH WAS 33 FOR LINE RENTAL NO FREE CALLS AND THEN PAY LIKE UP TO 15 JUST FOR LOCAL CALLS AND THEN WE MAKE LIKE AN EXTRA 15 FOR MOBILE STD FOR INTERNATIONAL WE MAKE A LOCAL CALL AND USE A CALLING CARD WHICH IS EVEN CHEAPER… SO 29 95 AND THAT’S ALL WHY – COS I CHANGED ISP TO IINET COST ONLY 79 95 PER MONTH BUT I GET 10 OFF PER MONTH COS I ALSO JOINED THEIR IIPHONE WHICH MEANS I ONLY PAY 69 95 FOR LIKE 32GB DOWNLOAD WHICH I SERIOUSLY DOUBT I’LL EVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GOING OVER IF I DON’T PLAN TO DOWNLOAD CRAP LOADS OF STUFF AND IT’S A 512 128 CONNECTION 32GB FOR LESS THAN 70… THEN IIPHONE THERE ARE NO MONTHLY FEES OR ANYTHING IT JUST FOR MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AND STD CALLS WE’LL NEVER USE THE INTERNATIONAL CALLS BUT AS FOR THE STD AND MOBILE CALLS THEY HAVE THE CHEAPEST RATES OUT OF ALL THE PROVIDERS I HAVE EVER SEEN SO THAT MEANS WE’LL LOVER THAT 15 TO MOBILES TO MAYBE 10… SO IF I ADD UP EVERYTHING THAT’S ONLY 100 PER MONTH FOR ALL PHONE AND INTERNET – WHICH IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL THAN OUR CURRENT 160 PER MONTH DEAL… SO YEAH ALL IS GOOD SAVE PARENTS 60 PER MONTH AND WE’LL GET TO USE THE PHONE MORE AND NOT PAY AS MUCH OKAY… NOT THAT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW ALL THAT CRAP – BUT MAN THAT TOOK ME AGES… 1 ½ HOURS TO GET DONE… AND WELL 328 WORDS TO TYPE WHAT I DID S I SPENT LIKE SOME TIME YESTERDAY NIGHT TO CHECK OUT MOBILE PLANS AND THEN ENDED UP WITH HOME PHONE PLANS AND I ALSO CAME ACROSS THE NET PLAN SO I JUST GOT EVERYTHING CHANGED THE NEXT DAY NO RASH DECISION ALL FIGURED OUT BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE NET THING FOR AGES MOBILE PLANS… WHY WAS I CHECKING THEM OUT – WELL SUPPOSEDLY MY FAMILY’S GONNA HAVE A ABN NUMBER… MEANING I CAN SIGN UP FOR BUSINESS PLANS… AND THE THING IS BUSINESS MOBILE PLANS HAVE THE CHEAPEST IMAGINABLE RATES… SO YEAH IT’LL BE GOOD ONLY DOWN SIDE OF THINGS IS THAT THEY DON’T OFFER YES TIME… WHICH I GUESS RIGHT NOW ISN’T SUCH A BIG DEAL COS I’LL JUST GET PEOPLE TO CALL ME BUT
