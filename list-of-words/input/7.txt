YOU SHOULD REALISE THAT EVERYWHERE IN LONDON IS A COMPLETE MYSTERY TO ME AND BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF THE PLACE IT S AN ADVENTURE EVERY TIME I HEAD IN TO TOWN BUT EVEN SO IT S QUITE STRANGE STEPPING OUT OF A TUBE STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF LONDON WALKING ABOUT 200 METRES UP THE ROAD AND SUDDENLY FEELING LIKE YOU COULD BE IN SOME SMALL TOWN OR VILLAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMERSET OR SOMEWHERE EQUALLY NOT LONDON BUT THAT S WHAT I MANAGED TO DO YESTERDAY AS I WALKED THROUGH HIGHGATE THE REASON I WAS MAKING MY WAY FAIRLY QUICKLY I WAS LATE THROUGH THAT AREA OF NORTH LONDON WAS BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO A PREVIEW SHOW OF ADE S NEW PLAY QUOT SUCCESS QUOT AT THE URLLINK GATEHOUSE THEATRE A ONE MAN SHOW WRITTEN AND STARRING THE MAN HIMSELF I VE NEVER BEEN TO A SMALL SCALE PRODUCTION LIKE THAT BEFORE AND CONSIDERING THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 20 PEOPLE THERE IT WAS VERY SMALL BUT ENJOYED THOROUGHLY ENJOYED MYSELF ADE S OFF UP TO EDINBURGH NEXT WEEK FOR THE FRINGE FESTIVAL AND LET S HOPE FOR ANOTHER AWARD FOR HIM ANOTHER BONUS OF THE NIGHT WAS THAT WE SORTED OUT WHO GOT WHICH ROOM IN THE HOUSE I GOT THE MIDDLE ROOM I WAS AFTER HOORAY
FOR SOMEONE NEW TO LONDON OR JUST VISITING AS I HAVE IN THE PAST THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS A SAVIOUR DESPITE BEING HOT CROWDED AND LATE GET A TRAVELCARD AND YOU CAN JUST FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AT ALL BUT THE PROBLEM WITH NAVIGATING LONDON VIA THE TUBE IS THAT IT GIVES A TOTALLY SKEWED IMPRESSION OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE PLACE PEOPLE GET THE TUBE WHEN WALKING WOULD HAVE TAKEN HALF THE TIME IF ONLY THEY KNEW WHERE THEY WERE GOING FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PAST I VE GONE FROM TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD TO COVENT GARDEN BY GETTING THE NORTHERN LINE TO LEICESTER SQUARE AND THEN CHANGING ON TO THE PICADILLY LINE NOW THAT PROBABLY TOOK ABOUT 25 MINUTES BUT IF I D JUST WALKD I COULD HAVE DONE IT IN 15 ISH A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I BOUGHT AN A Z WHICH HAS PUT A FEW THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE BUT FOR THE MOST PART I M STILL STUCK ON TUBE GEOGRAPHY YESTERDAY I CAME ACROSS A URLLINK HANDY LITTLE WEB PAGE WHICH GIVES A NUMBER OF TUBE MAPS INCLUDING A URLLINK GEOGRAPHICALLY CORRECT MAP OF THE UNDERGROUND NICE TO SEE BUT DOESN T REALLY GIVE YOU AN IMPRESSION OF HOW YOU CAN GET FROM PLACE TO ANOTHER BUT ALSO INCLUDED ON THAT PAGE IS A PDF OF THE URLLINK GEOGRAPHICAL MAP SUPERIMPROSED ONTO A STREET MAP IT SHOWS LANDMARKS TRAIN STATIONS AND RAILWAY LINES TUBE STOP AND LINES ALL IN THE CORRECT LOCATIONS SO NOW YOU REALLY CAN SEE JUST HOW QUICK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO WALK INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THE COMMUTE
