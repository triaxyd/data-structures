GMAIL HAS A REALLY COOL WAY TO VIEW MESSAGES THAT ARE RELATED RATHER THEN GETTING SEVERAL EMAILS WITH A SUBJECT OF RE SOMETHING IT GROUPS THE MESSAGES TOGETHER AS ONE MESSAGE GMAIL HAS THIS IDEA OF A CONVERSATION RATHER THAN AN EMAIL MESSAGE SO IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO GROUP MESSAGES TOGETHER OF THE SAME SUBJECT IN THE SAME CONVERSATION FURTHER MORE I BELIEVE THAT IS HOW WE SHOULD VIEW EMAIL MESSAGES ANYWAY AS CONVERSATIONS IF SOMEONE IS REPLYING BACK TO YOU THEY REALLY TALKING BACK TO YOU LIKE YOU RE IN A CONVERSATION I PLAN TO GET PICTURES UP AS SOON AS I FIGURE THAT OUT
AS AN ACTIVE BLOGGER COM USER I WAS INVITED TO START USING GMAIL WHEN I ORIGINALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT GMAIL I WASN T GOING TO TRY AND SIGN UP BUT SINCE I WAS GETTING A DIRECT INVITATION I DECIDED TO TRY IT SO HERE I AM STARTING TO RECORD MY EXPERIENCE WITH GMAIL AT FIRST I WASN T SURE WHAT TO EXPECT I KNEW ABOUT THE 1GB OF DISK SPACE BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT I M FINDING THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF NO BRAINER FEATURES LIKE AUTOMATICALLY CREATING ADDRESS BOOK ENTRIES THREADING MESSAGES AND REPLIES IN AN EASY TO READ FORMAT AND LABELING MESSAGES RATHER THAN STORING THEM TO FOLDERS AS THE WEEKS GO ON I LL CONTINUE TO POST UPDATES OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH GMAIL THIS IS MY FIRST DAY IN SO I M JUST ABSORBING THE WHOLE THING
URLLINK PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT GMAIL THE SEARCH PANEL I COULDN T AGREE WITH GOOGLE MORE ON THE FACT THAT YOU SHOULDN T DELETE ANY EMAIL RATHER SEARCH FOR IT WHEN YOU NEED IT I THINK IT SAVES A TON OF TIME TRYING TO ORGANIZE INCOMING MESSAGES SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGED IS WHEN SEARCHING FOR MESSAGES FROM A SPECIFIC PERSON WHEN COMPOSING A NEW EMAIL THERE IS A NICE AUTO COMPLETE THAT TRIES TO COMPLETE THE ADDRESS OF THE PERSON YOU ARE SENDING THE MESSAGE TO I M NOT SURE WHY THIS ISN T IN PLACE WHEN SEARCHING TO ME IT WOULD MAKE SENSE SINCE GMAIL IS ALREADY AWARE OF EVERYONE YOU HAVE SENT RECIVED MESSAGES WITH
THE OTHER DAY WHEN I O SO KINDLY USED UP ONE OF MY INVITES ON MYSELF I LEARNED A LITTLE SOMETHING THAT IS YOU CANNOT CREATE A GMAIL USER NAME WITH THE PHRASE GMAIL IN IT HERE ARE SOME OF THE NAMES THAT I TRIED TO REGISTER GMAILEXPERIENCE MY FIRST TRY TO MATCH MY BLOG EXPERIENCE SOMEONE HAVE THIS ALREADY GMAIL EXPERIENCE GMAILEXP GMAILEXP1 GMAILEXP234234234 THIS IS WHERE I GAVE UP
I WANT TO RECIEVE FEEDBACK OR QUESTIONS FROM ANYONE WHO READS THIS BLOG BUT I DON T WANT TO GET ANY SPAM IN MY NEW GMAIL ACCOUNT JUST IN CASE I WANT TO USE IT FOR REAL IN THE FUTURE SO WHAT DO I DO I INVITED MYSELF TO JOIN GMAIL I KNOW THOSE OF YOU WITHOUT GMAIL WILL PROBABLY WANT TO KILL ME COMMENTS QUESTIONS URLLINK G EXPERIENCE GMAIL COM
SOMETHING TO NOTE IS THAT GMAIL WILL STILL BE FLAKY FOR A WHILE EVEN WHEN THE DO GO PRODUCTION WITH THEIR SERVICE WHILE GOOGLE IS REALLY INNOVATIVE WITH NEW PRODUCTS THEY LACK EXPERIENCE THAT OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS SUCH AS YAHOO ALREADY HAVE AS MY EXPERIENCE YESTERDAY WITH SENDING AUTOMATED EMAIL TO MY ACCOUNT I NEVER RECEIVED IT I SUPPOSE WE LL WAIT AND SEE FOR NOW I M STILL USING YAHOO AS MY PRIMARY SPAM ACCOUNT AND OF COURSE I STILL HAVE MY PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNT WITH A ISP THAT I PAY FOR
URLLINK SOMETHING I FAILED TO SHOW IN THE LAST TWO PICTURES IS THE HELPFUL LITTLE DROP DOWN WHEN YOU START TO TYPE AN EMAIL ADDRESS INTO THE WINDOW GMAIL AUTOMATICALLY STARTS TO HELP YOU WITH THE ADDRESS YOU RE SENDING THE EMAIL TO NBSP URLLINK
URLLINK HERE S THE REPLY TO THE SAME MESSAGE NBSP URLLINK
URLLINK HERE S A SHOT OF THE MESSAGES I WAS WRITING YESTERDAY NOTHING REAL FANCY TO SEE ON THIS SCREEN BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE TEXTAREA S WHERE YOU ENTER THE MESSAGES IN ARE RESIZABLE I HAVEN T LOOKED TO SEE IF THEY ARE ACTUALLY TEXT AREA S OR IF THEY ARE IFRAME S BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DON T USUALLY SEE IN WEB SITE USERS ARE USALLY CONFINED TO THE EXACT SIZE THAT THE WEB DEVELOPER SET NBSP URLLINK
URLLINK ANOTHER PICTURE OF A GMAIL CONVERSTION ONLY THE OLD MESSAGE IS COMPRESSED SO YOU ONLY SEE THE HEADING OF IT TO VIEW THE FULL MESSAGES JUST CLICK ON THE HEADER OF THE OLD MESSAGE AND YOU WILL SEE THE ENTIRE MESSAGE
URLLINK THIS IS A PICTURE OF A GMAIL CONVERSATION OR WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE USED TO AS GETTING A REPLY BACK FROM SOMEONE NOTICE THAT IT NICELY DISPLAYS THE TWO MESSAGES TOGETHER IN AN EASY TO READ FORMAT WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A TRADITION EMAIL IS TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MESSAGES
SO I M ABOUT READY TO POST SOME NEW GMAIL PICTURES THROUGH THE HELLO PROGRAM FOR BLOGGER BUT IT WANTS ME TO VERIFY MY EMAIL ADDRESS SURE I M USING MY GMAIL ACCOUNT TO MANAGE THIS ACCOUNT SO I HAVE IT SEND AN AUTOMATED EMAIL TO MY ACCOUNT I M WAITING I M WAITING CLICKING REFRESH SIGNING IN AND OUT OF GMAIL AND STILL NOTHING I GET SO TIRED OF WAITING THAT I CHANGE THE ADDRESS THAT HELLO USES FOR ME TO MY YAHOO ACCOUNT NO PROBLEM THERE I RECEIVE THE EMAIL IN LESS THAN A MINUTE AGAIN WHAT S GOING ON WITH GMAIL I SURE HOPE I GET THOSE MESSAGES SOON
I DON T THINK I VE EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE URLLINK THIS POST BEFORE IT S A LIST OF PEOPLE DESPERATELY SEEKING A GMAIL ACCOUNT WHICH THIS BLOGGER HAS SO KINDLY COLLECTED A FEW THOUSAND NAMES I MUST ADMIT I STILL HAVE NOT USED ALL MY GMAIL INVITATIONS BUT I REALLY ONLY WANT TO HAND THEM OUT TO PEOPLE WHO I KNOW WILL USE THEM TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE ON THE LIST JUST WAIT WHILE GMAIL IS COOL AND ALL IT S JUST ANOTHER EMAIL ACCOUNT TO MANAGE
URLLINK THIS IS THE WELCOME MESSAGE FROM GOOGLE WHEN YOU FIRST SIGN INTO YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT NOTICE THE LABELS ON THE LEFT WHICH I VE HAD TO BLACK OUT SOME FOR PRIVACY THEY ALMOST APPEAR AS FOLDERS NOTICE THE LIGHT ADVERTISING ON THE RIGHT FAR CLEANER THAN YAHOO ADVERTISING OVERALL A VERY CLEAN SCREEN AS I HAVE TIME I LL POINT OUT SOME OTHER INTERESTING FEATURES WHEN VIEWING A MESSAGE NBSP URLLINK
URLLINK GMAIL SIGN IN SCREEN NBSP URLLINK
ACCORDING TO GOOGLE THEY HAVE REACHED A POINT IN TESTING WHERE THEY ARE READY TO START BRINGING MORE PEOPLE ON NOT PUBLICLY OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMEONE AND HAVE THEM INVITE YOU TO USE IT I VE INVITED TWO PEOPLE ALREADY AND IT LOOKS LIKE I CAN KEEP GOING
I HAVEN T POSTED ANYTHING OUT HERE IN A WHILE AND THAT S BECAUSE I VE BEEN PRETTY BUSY I STILL INTEND ON MAINTAINING THIS BLOG HOWEVER I NEED TO TAKE A BREAK FROM IT HOPEFULLY GMAIL WILL STILL BE IN BETA MODE BY THE TIME I CAN GET SOME MORE POSTS OUT HERE IF NOT HEY HAVE FUN
URLLINK THIS POP3 PROGRAM FOR GMAIL HAS RECENTLY SURFACED AS I DISCOVERED IT LAST WEEK IT REALLY HAD ME THINKING OF WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO USE A TRADITIONAL EMAIL CLIENT TO READ THEIR GMAIL ONCE YOU PULL YOUR GMAIL OFF THE SERVER YOUR RIGHT BACK WERE YOU STARTED THE IDEA BEHIND GMAIL IS THE FEATURES AND THE PUBLIC SPACE OF 1GB NON OF WHICH ARE AVAILABLE ONCE YOU DOWNLOAD ALL YOUR MAIL WHY A POP3 PROGRAM FOR GMAIL I COULD SEE THIS PROGRAM BEING EXTREMELY HANDY IF YOU EVER NEEDED TO CONVERT FROM GMAIL TO ANOTHER SERVICE PROVIDER YOU COULD SIMPLY DOWNLOAD YOUR EMAIL FROM GMAIL AND YOU RE DONE NO REASON TO LOGIN TO GMAIL ANY MORE
I INVITED ONE USER FROM MY GMAIL ACCOUNT TO JOIN GMAIL AND NOW I DON T HAVE ANY INVITES LEFT I DON T UNDERSTAND WHY IT TOOK ONLY ONE PLEASE DON T ASK FOR A GMAIL ACCOUNT UNTIL I KNOW THAT I HAVE MORE I LL POST ANOTHER MESSAGE WHEN I GET MORE INVITES
FINALLY AFTER PUBLICLY ADVERTISING MY NEW GMAIL ADDRESS ON THE INTERNET I RECIEVED MY FIRST SPAM MESSAGE URLLINK NOTICE THAT IT PLACED IT IN MY SPAM BOX GOOGLE SAYS THE GMAIL SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY EMPTY YOUR TRASH AND SPAM EVERY 30 DAYS SO WE LL WAIT AND SEE IF IT IS REMOVED URLLINK
SO I HAVE MORE GMAIL INVITES THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH AT THE MOMENT IF YOU RE INTERESTED SEND URLLINK ME AND EMAIL
