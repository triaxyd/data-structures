THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST RECENT MOVIES THAT I HAVE SEEN I SAW IT ON SUNDAY WITH MY SISTER AND AGAIN ON TUESDAY NIGHT WITH ALL OF MY FAMILY IN MY OPINION THIS ONE IS WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE THE ACTION SCENES ARE WAY BETTER TOBEY MCGUIRE IS NOW A MUCH MORE EXPERIENCED ACTOR AND KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING I LIKED THE PLOT AS WELL DOC OCK WAS PLAYED EXTREMELY WELL BY ALFRED MOLINA THE ENDING WAS NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING BUT IT DOES LEAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR A SPIDERMAN 3 HOPEFULLY THAT MOVIE IS NOT GOING TO BE TOO FAR FROM NOW TWO THUMBS WAY UP FOR THIS MOVIE NBSP A
